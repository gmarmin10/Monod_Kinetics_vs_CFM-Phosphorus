# Monod_Kinetics_vs_CFM-Phosphorus
Using CFM-Phyto to capture similar trend as Monod mathematical formulation for growth rate and phosphorus concentration


Any code denoted with name "Monod" uses the Monod formualtion to capture the trend of growth rate with increasing phosphorus concentration. 
Any code with the name "CFM" uses CFM_phyto to capture the trend of growth rate with increasing concentration. If the word "combine" or "combo" is used, that plots CFM and Monod on the same plot. 

The CFM files without a version of the word "combine" also output plots of macromolecular allocation. 

General macromolecular allocation, not specified to a species, is outputted in the code titled, "J000_00_10_beginning.py". 

The other names in these titles denote which species or paper the data is coming from. Each species from the denoted paper has an accompanying data file, also included here. 

The "sf" file saves the figures to your computer, so be sure to change the directory there in order for the code to run.
