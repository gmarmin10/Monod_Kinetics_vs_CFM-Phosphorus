# Monod_Kinetics_vs_CFM-Phosphorus
Using CFM-Phyto to capture similar trend as Monod mathematical formulation for growth rate and phosphorus concentration


Any code denoted with name "Monod" uses the Monod formualtion to capture the trend of growth rate with increasing phosphorus concentration. 
Any code with the name "CFM" uses CFM_phyto to capture the trend of growth rate with increasing concentration. 

The other names in these titles denote which species or paper the data is coming from. Each species from the denoted paper has an accompanying data file, also included here.
